Image Viewer is the first version of a viewer for microscopy images. It supports TIFF files and provides a window which contains the image being viewed.
When the window is resized, the image is scaled to fit in the window.
To select the image file to open, there is a menu "File" with an "Open" entry which displays a file selection dialog.
